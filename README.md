## Purpose of the Controller Class

This is an abstract base class designed for a modular, object-oriented Express.js application using TypeScript. All your specific route controllers (like UserController, AuthController, etc.) will inherit from this class to ensure consistency and reduce repetition in how routes are defined and registered.

### File Overview

```ts
import { Router } from 'express';
import { IRoute } from './types';
```

-   Router: This is Express' built-in class used to create modular route handlers.
-   IRoute: This is a TypeScript interface that defines the shape of each route config object (method, path, handler, middleware). It's imported from a types.ts file.

### Class Definition

```ts
export default abstract class Controller {}
```

-   This is an abstract class, meaning:
    -   It can't be instantiated directly.
    -   Itâ€™s meant to be extended by other classes (like UserController).
    -   It enforces structure, such as requiring path and routes.

### Router Property

```ts
public router: Router = Router();
```

-   This creates a new Express Router instance.
-   All defined routes inside this controller will be attached to this router.
-   Later, this router is mounted on a specific base path in the app (e.g., /api/v1/users).

### Abstract path

```ts
public abstract path: string;
```

-   Each child controller must provide a path string, e.g., /users.
-   This path is used when mounting the controller inside your Server Class:

```ts
app.use(controller.path, controller.setRoutes());
```

### Abstract routes

```ts
protected abstract readonly routes: IRoute[];
```

-   This enforces that any controller extending this base class must provide a list of routes.
-   IRoute[] defines the structure:

```ts
interface IRoute {
    path: string;
    method: 'get' | 'post' | 'put' | 'delete'; // etc.
    handler: RequestHandler;
    localMiddleware: RequestHandler[];
}
```
